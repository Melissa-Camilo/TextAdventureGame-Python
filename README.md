A) Introduction:     
  The game is based around the idea of Kingdom Hearts, a video game that combines anime and Disney in one. 
  (Video Game Trailer: https://youtu.be/eOtOzByZ4dY).  While it takes several elements of this game it changes
  a fighting game into a game of minigames and it is not necessary to know the game to enjoy it, although knowledge 
  of the game will enhance the experience.         
      Game 1: Tic Tac Toe         
      Game 2: Roll the Dice         
      Game 3: Higher or Lower         
      Game 4: Guess the Lyrics      
   Little skills are required and the purpose is to get to the end of the game without losing
   at any point.
